# Srevrtt's Road Pack

## **About**

Srevrtt's Road Pack is a simple resource pack that allows for more accurate road creation inside Minecraft. The goal is for you, the builder, to more easily construct better roads without many compromises.

The pack uses glazed terracotta currently as its main block for roads. Unless you really like this block and/or you are planning to use/already using this block, you should be fine when using this resource pack. I'm currently thinking about using biome-specific textures (via Optifine) to avoid this issue.

## **Future Versions Note**

Yes, this is only for 1.12 currently. I will be working on versions working up to the latest version (1.20.1). I might work on this project for older versions, but I am not sure yet.

## **What is this repo for?**

This is really for reporting issues or feature requests with the pack. Pull reqeusts are not allowed.
